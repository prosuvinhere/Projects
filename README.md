# Hi, I'm Suvin! üëã
Former Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corporation Intern | B.Tech in Computer Science (VIT Vellore) | Skills: LLM, DSA, MERN, AWS

## üöÄ About Me
I am a B.Tech Computer Science student at VIT Vellore with a CGPA of 8.5+. I am passionate about exploring new technologies and am dedicated to excelling in this rapidly evolving field.

During my internship at TMEIC, I developed a chatbot for IT support using Large Language Models (LLM). Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning, our goal was to create an intelligent chatbot capable of handling various IT support queries. This project provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in AI and deepened my understanding of natural language processing techniques.

I recently achieved the AWS Certified Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate (AWS SAA) certification, marking a significant milestone in my career. This certification demonstrates my expertise in designing distributed systems on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and I'm excited to leverage it to further my career in cloud computing.

I'm skilled in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, covering both frontend and backend development. I'm excited to leverage this expertise to create innovative web solutions.
